# Time-Series Analyses of Population Dynamics of an Engineered Bioreactor Ecosystem at Multiple Scales of Resolution

This repository contains executables, submit files, and scripts for analyzing time-series data at multiple scales of resolution (16S rRNA amplicon, qPCR, genome-resolved metagenomics) of an engineered enrichment bioreactor simulating EBPR operating from 2005-2013 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The time-series and analyses specifically focus on operation from 2010-2013 as this was a stable period of operation for the R1 reactor.

Raw data and results files including 16S OTU and taxonomy tables, qPCR results, sample extraction sheets, and chemical metadata are in the [R1 Bioreactor Figshare Project Repository](https://figshare.com/projects/R1_EBPR_Bioreactor_Long-Term_Time-Series/149209)

Raw sequencing files such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing fastq files, shotgun metagenomic sequencing fastq files, and non-redundant metagenome-assembled genome FASTAs are available on NCBI at the [Bioproject Accession PRJNA881607](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA881607).
